Memory safety refers to protection from bugs and vulnerabilities which deal with *memory* access. Buffer overflows and dangling pointers are examples of this. Java is considered a memory-safe language due to its runtime error detection checks. However, C and C++ both allow arbitrary pointer arithmetic with direct memory addresses and no bounds checking.

### NSA Suggested Memory-Safe Programming Languages

- Rust
- Go
- C#
- Java
- Swift
- JavaScript
- Ruby
